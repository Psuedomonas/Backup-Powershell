# Backup-Powershell
Automate and configure file backups with powershell

Powershell script to back up two folders (dentrix and dexis). The script is launched via batch script to avoid altering powershell security settings. Uses windows forms for GUI for user input

ToDo:
Preferably provide a Windows form that allows path selection for backup for ease of use.
Complete automation step (if it will be included)
Complete backup scripts with source directories (may exclude from github... maybe)
Test final version
Add Liscence
Make a proper readme file

Future:
Update for later releases of Dentrix and Dexis
