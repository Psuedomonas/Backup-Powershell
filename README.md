# Backup-Powershell
Automate and configure file backups with powershell

Backup-Powershell is a batch script and a powershell script that automates backups of Dentrix and Dexis software, then shuts down the computer.

The script is activated by the user clicking/launching the batch file
> AutomateBackup.bat

This launches the powershell script without requiring changes to powershell script run permissions. The script provides the user with a windows form GUI for directing the backup location. The Dentrix and Dexis are backed up to the user selected directory.

## To Install (if needed)
Simply place both scripts in the same directory.


## Roadmap
Current Version:

* Complete backup scripts with source directories (may exclude from github... maybe)
* Test final version
* Add License
* Make a proper read-me file
* Clean GUI a bit

Future Version(s):
* Update for later releases of Dentrix and Dexis
